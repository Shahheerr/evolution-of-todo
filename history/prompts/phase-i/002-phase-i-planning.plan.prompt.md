## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Phase-I terminal-based Todo application. Generated all required planning artifacts including: main plan (plan.md), research summary (research.md), data model (data-model.md), quickstart guide (quickstart.md), and API contracts (contracts/api-contract.md). Verified constitution compliance and updated agent context with new technology stack information.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete planning phase with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created 5 planning documents and updated CLAUDE.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: All planning artifacts align with constitution and feature spec
